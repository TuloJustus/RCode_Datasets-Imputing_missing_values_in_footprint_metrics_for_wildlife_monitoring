# RCode_Datasets-Imputing_missing_values_in_footprint_metrics_for_wildlife_monitoring

This repository belongs to the paper "Imputing missing values in footprint metrics for wildlife monitoring".  The aim of the project is the imputation of missing so-called landmark points in images of animal footprints. The imputation of missing points is necessary for the classification and identification of the footprints by calculating distances, angles and areas of the landmark points. In total, the footprints of five different animals were examined. In each case, artificially missing values are generated in the present datasets and then imputed. All used data sets and R codes with self-written functions and examples are deposited in this respository.
